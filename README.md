# Vinyl

A small webserver written in Go to allow mobile clients to upload files to a computer on a private network. I built it to allow my partner to upload files from their phone to our Plex server, so we can stream them locally from any Plex client.

Usage:

```bash
vinyl path/to/upload/location plex-refresh-token
```
